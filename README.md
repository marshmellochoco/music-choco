# music-choco

The goal of this project is to develop an audio streaming application similar to Spotify Web Player (without making it as a total clone of it). Reason for me to established this project is to practise my React skills and learn more about full-stack development, as well as to maintain and manage a project.

## Getting Started
### Pre-requisite
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (or npm)

### Setting up development environment
```
git clone https://github.com/marshmellochoco/music-choco.git
cd music-choco && npm i
npm start
```
Or you can view the live demo [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

### Note
If you found that it is not working, most likely it is note connected to the backend yet (oops!). You can get the files and  host it yourself [here](https://github.com/marshmellochoco/music-choco-server).
