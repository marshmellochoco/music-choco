# music-choco

This is the second version of the audio streaming application. After going through the first version, I found out that there are quite alot of improvement that can be done to make it better. So I decided to rewrite the whole system including the front-end and back-end but still using the same tech stack (MERN). The first version is in the v1 branch of the same repository.

## Getting Started
### Pre-requisite
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (or npm)

### Setting up development environment
```
git clone https://github.com/marshmellochoco/music-choco.git
cd music-choco && npm i
npm start
```

Or you can view the live demo [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

### Note
Rename .env-example to .env and enter your API url into the REACT_APP_API_URL field.
If you found that it is not working, most likely it is note connected to the backend yet (oops!). You can get the files and host it yourself [here](https://github.com/marshmellochoco/music-choco-server).
